# Hi there, I'm [Khris] ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and other programming languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly coding projects.
- ðŸ¥… 2023>2024 Goals:
-    Enhancing my coding skills, particularly in Python, and deepening my understanding of network systems. I aim to contribute to open-source projects,
-    which will serve as my digital construction sites, becoming a software developer or network specialist. Alongside my technical goals, I'm also
-    focused on building a strong foundation in IT fundamentals through Windows cmd promt & servers, Microsoft C#, and other essential tools and more.
-    Ultimately, I'm excited to connect with a community of like-minded learners and professionals who share the passion for creating, problem-solving,
-    and continuous learning in the tech space.
-    
- 
- âš¡ Fun fact:
-    I've swapped my hard hat and tire levers for code and command lines, transitioning from construction and tire tech to the world of IT.
-    Now, I'm on a mission to build structures in the digital realm as a budding software developer or network specialist. Along the way, I'm tackling
-    Python and mastering the Windows Command Prompt, one line of code at a time.

## My GitHub Project: Code Puzzles for Beginners
Welcome to my GitHub project! This is a space where beginners can challenge themselves with code puzzles that are designed to improve your debugging skills.

### What You'll Find Here
- **Code Puzzles**: I'll post new code puzzles with intentional syntax errors or tracebacks for you to solve.
- **Solutions**: Before attempting the puzzles, try avoiding seeing comments. I don't want to spoil your experience feeling you have accomplished or achieved puzzles, after you can check your solutions against mine.
- **Learning Resources**: I'll share resources that have been helpful to me in my coding journey.

### How to Get Involved
- **Try the Puzzles**: Clone the repository, solve the puzzles, and compare your solutions.
- **Share Your Solutions**: If you're comfortable, share your solutions and discuss different approaches with the community.
- **Feedback and Collaboration**: Feel free to fork the repository, suggest changes, or collaborate on creating new puzzles.

### Looking for Collaborators!
If you're interested in creating puzzles, learning together, or just chatting about code, I'd love to hear from you. Here's how you can reach me:

## Additional Ideas in The Future:

- **Weekly Challenges**: Introduce a weekly challenge with a specific theme or topic.
- **Live Coding Sessions**: Organize live coding sessions where you solve puzzles with others in real-time.
- **Mentorship Program**: Pair up experienced developers with beginners for a mentorship program.
- **Resource Library**: Create a curated list of resources for learning Python and other languages.
- **Community Events**: Host or participate in community events like hackathons or coding competitions.
